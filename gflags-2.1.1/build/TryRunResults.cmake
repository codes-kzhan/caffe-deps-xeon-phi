# This file was generated by CMake because it detected TRY_RUN() commands
# in crosscompiling mode. It will be overwritten by the next CMake run.
# Copy it to a safe location, set the variables to appropriate values
# and use it then to preset the CMake cache (using -C).


# THREADS_PTHREAD_ARG
#    indicates whether the executable would have been able to run on its
#    target platform. If so, set THREADS_PTHREAD_ARG to
#    the exit code (in many cases 0 for success), otherwise enter "FAILED_TO_RUN".
# The THREADS_HAVE_PTHREAD_ARG variable holds the build result for this TRY_RUN().
